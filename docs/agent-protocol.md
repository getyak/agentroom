# AgentRoom Agent Protocol (v0)

The personal desktop A2A path additionally supports [host-mediated chat tools](api.md#agent-callable-chat-tools-get-542). This is distinct from the retained Matrix protocol below. Strict JSON tool requests and per-round identities work over ordinary `message/send` / `tasks/get`; there is no remote callback bearer or owner impersonation.

This protocol lets any AI agent become a contact in AgentRoom. It is plain HTTP + JSON with bearer tokens in both directions.

There are two sides:

- The **agent**, the server you write.
- The **bridge**, `agentstudio-bridge-agents`, which runs inside an AgentRoom deployment.

Each AgentRoom connection to an agent is a **session**: one user talking to one agent in one conversation.

## Connecting

A user adds an agent in AgentRoom under *Connect, Agents*. The flows are:

- `endpoint`: the user enters the agent's base URL and an optional access token.
- `concierge`: the built-in reference agent, from `AGENTSTUDIO_CONCIERGE_URL`. There are no fields.

The bridge then runs these calls:

1. `GET {base}/agentstudio/v0/info` returns `AgentInfo`.
2. `POST {base}/agentstudio/v0/sessions` with body `{ "callback_url", "callback_token", "user": { "display_name" }, "session_id"? }` returns `{ "session_id" }`.
   - `callback_url` is the bridge's per-session URL, `{bridge}/agentstudio/v0/callback/{session_key}`.
   - `callback_token` is a random 32-byte token. The agent must send it back on every callback. The bridge stores only its hash.
   - `session_id` is set when the bridge re-registers a session it already has. The agent should resume it and return the same id, but may return a new one.
3. The bridge creates the DM room with the agent ghost and registers the agent with the API.

The bridge re-registers every session (step 2, with `session_id` and a fresh `callback_token`) when it starts, and again whenever the agent answers a call with 404. Agents that keep sessions in memory therefore survive restarts of either side; the old callback token stops working once a new one is issued.

Bridge-side ids (stable, so connecting the same agent again reuses the room and the session):

- `user_login_id` = `agent-` + the first 12 hex chars of `sha256(owner mxid + "\n" + base URL)`.
- Agent ghost: `@agents_<user_login_id>:agentstudio.local`. Agent id / connection id in the API: `agentstudio-agents:<user_login_id>`.

If the user entered an access token, the bridge sends it on every call to the agent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

```ts
type AgentInfo = {
  name: string                  // shown as the contact name
  description?: string
  avatar_url?: string           // https URL; the bridge re-uploads it to Matrix
  capabilities: ("chat" | "ask" | "approvals")[]
  protocol: "agentstudio-agent/0"
}
```

## Bridge → agent

Every call carries `X-AgentStudio-Session: <session_id>`. The agent should reply quickly and do slow work asynchronously, sending results through callbacks.

| Call | When | Reply |
|---|---|---|
| `POST {base}/agentstudio/v0/messages` | The user sends a message or an ask | `202 {}` |
| `POST {base}/agentstudio/v0/approvals/{external_id}/decision` | The user decides on an approval | `200 {}` |
| `DELETE {base}/agentstudio/v0/sessions/{session_id}` | The user removes the agent | `204` |

`/messages` body:

```ts
type InboundMessage = {
  session_id: string
  message_id: string            // Matrix event id
  text: string
  sent_at: string
  ask?: {                       // present for "Ask an agent"
    task_id: string
    app: string                 // origin network name, e.g. "Demo"
    chat: string                // origin chat name, already anonymized
    request: string             // what the user asked for, e.g. "Draft a reply"
    lines: { speaker: string; own: boolean; ts: number; text: string }[]
  }
}
```

The decision body is `{ "approval_id": string, "choice": string }`, where `choice` is one of the keys the agent offered.

## Agent → bridge (callbacks)

The agent sends `POST {callback_url}/events` with `Authorization: Bearer <callback_token>` and one event per call. The bridge handles the event before it replies, so an agent that waits for each reply gets its events shown in order. The bridge replies:

- `200 { "ok": true }` when the event was handled.
- `400` for an invalid event (see the limits below), `401` on a bad token and `404` on an unknown session.
- `502` when the bridge could not deliver the event (Matrix or the API failed). The agent may retry; `approval_request` is idempotent on `external_id`.

Limits: text fields at most 20000 characters, ids and choice keys at most 200 bytes, at most 20 `details`, request bodies at most 256 KiB.

```ts
type AgentEvent =
  | { type: "message"; text: string /* may be empty when there are attachments */; reply_to?: string /* message_id */
      attachments?: { url: string /* http(s) */; name?: string; mime_type?: string }[] /* 0..10 */
      from_user?: boolean; via?: string /* the user said this in the service's own app, e.g. "Grok Bot" */
      history?: boolean; ts?: string /* RFC 3339: earlier conversation imported on connect */ }
  | { type: "drafts"; task_id: string; drafts: { text: string }[] /* 1..5 */; text?: string /* optional lead-in */ }
  | { type: "approval_request"; external_id: string; title: string; summary?: string
      details?: { label: string; value: string }[]
      choices: { key: string; label: string; category: "approve" | "deny" }[] /* 2..4, at least one approve and one deny */
      expires_in_seconds?: number }
  | { type: "approval_cancel"; external_id: string }
  | { type: "status"; state: "idle" | "working"; text?: string }
  | { type: "profile"; name?: string; avatar_url?: string }
```

What the bridge does with each event:

- `message`: posts an `m.text` from the agent ghost, then each attachment: the bridge downloads it (up to 25 MiB) and posts an `m.image` (for `image/*`) or `m.file`; one it can't fetch becomes a link. `from_user`/`via` and `history` become content keys clients read (see [matrix-events.md](matrix-events.md)); with `ts`, the message keeps its original time.
- `drafts`: posts an `m.notice` with content key `com.agentstudio.drafts` and marks the task answered.
- `approval_request`: creates the approval through the API, then posts an `m.text` with content key `com.agentstudio.approval`.
- `approval_cancel`: cancels the approval.
- `status`: updates the agent's status in the API.
- `profile`: updates the agent's name and/or avatar after the session started. The bridge downloads `avatar_url` and sets it as the ghost's Matrix avatar, so clients show it. Change the URL (for example with a version query) when the image changes.

## Reference agent: `concierge`

`server/cmd/agentstudio-agent-concierge` is deterministic so that tests can rely on it.

- `info` returns name "Concierge", capabilities `["chat", "ask", "approvals"]`.
- A message containing "flight" (case-insensitive) produces:
  1. `status working` with text "Searching flights".
  2. `message` "Found a nonstop to Toronto on Friday at 6:00 PM for $412."
  3. `approval_request`:
     - `external_id` = `flight-<message_id hash>`
     - title "Book the 6pm flight to Toronto for $412?"
     - details: Date "Friday", Route "Nonstop", Seat "14A, carry-on only"
     - choices: `book` "Book" (approve), `skip` "Don't book" (deny)
     - expires in 2700 s
  4. `status idle`.
- Decision `book` sends `message` "Booked. Seat 14A, confirmation PCH412." Decision `skip` sends `message` "Okay, I won't book it." A repeated decision for the same `external_id` is acknowledged without a second message.
- A message with `ask` produces a `drafts` event with three drafts for `task_id`:
  - "Sounds good, see you then!"
  - "Thanks! Let me check and get back to you."
  - "Got it 👍"
  These are prefixed with the speaker's first name when the last line is not own, e.g. "Leo, sounds good, see you then!". A speaker named `Person N` is used whole.
- Any other message gets the reply `message` "You said: <text>".

## Agents that speak other protocols

`agentstudio-agent-adapters` (port 18202) serves this protocol in front of agents that speak something else. The agents bridge connects them like any agent endpoint, through two extra login flows:

| Flow | Input | Adapter URL the bridge uses |
|---|---|---|
| `a2a` | the A2A agent's base URL (where `/.well-known/agent-card.json` is served), optional token | `{adapters}/a2a/{base64url(agent URL)}` |
| `acp` | one agent id from `AGENTSTUDIO_ACP_AGENTS` (a `select` field) | `{adapters}/acp/{agent id}` |

The flows exist only when the bridge has `AGENT_ADAPTERS_URL` set. The `acp` flow also needs at least one entry in `AGENTSTUDIO_ACP_AGENTS`.

### A2A (Agent2Agent, JSON-RPC binding v0.3)

- **Sessions and context.** One AgentRoom session is one A2A context. The adapter keeps the `contextId` the agent returns.
- **Sending.** User messages and asks go out as `message/send` (blocking). An ask becomes a prompt that asks for numbered drafts; the answer is parsed back into drafts.
- **Replies.** An agent `Message` becomes a chat message. A `Task` is followed with `tasks/get` until it is done or needs the user. While the task works, the agent shows the status `working`. Text artifacts and status messages become chat messages, and `failed` / `rejected` show as a warning.
- **`input-required`.**
  - If the status message carries a data part `{"agentstudio/approval": {title, summary?, details?, choices?, expires_in_seconds?}}`, AgentRoom shows an approval card. The user's choice goes back on that task as a data part `{"agentstudio/decision": {"choice": "<key>"}}` plus the choice label as text.
  - Without that data part, the question is shown in chat, and the user's next message continues the task.
- **Auth.** The user's token, if any, is sent as `Authorization: Bearer`.

### ACP (Agent Client Protocol, stdio)

The server operator allows ACP agents in `AGENTSTUDIO_ACP_AGENTS`, a JSON array of `{id, name, description?, command, args?, env?}`. Users pick an agent by id and never supply a command.

- **Process.** Each AgentRoom session runs its own agent process, started on the first message, in `AGENTSTUDIO_ACP_WORKDIR/<session>`. The adapter calls `initialize` without fs or terminal capabilities, then `session/new`.
- **Sending.** Messages and asks become `session/prompt`. The `agent_message_chunk` updates are joined into one reply, and `tool_call` titles update the agent's status.
- **Permissions.** `session/request_permission` becomes an approval card whose choices are the agent's options: `allow_*` maps to approve, `reject_*` to deny. The card expires after 30 minutes, and the agent then gets `cancelled`.

## Connectors on the Mac (Grok Bot, Muse, ChatGPT Dots)

These agents have no API for third parties. The Mac app connects them through the user's own signed-in session and serves this same protocol locally:

- Address: `http://127.0.0.1:18401/c/{instance}`, which listens on loopback only.
- Each instance has its own bearer token.
- The renderer registers an instance with the bridge through the `endpoint` flow.

See `docs/connectors.md`.

## Personal desktop artifact tools

Local Codex and Pi coauthor through per-run native tool sessions, separately from the retained Matrix agent protocol. The shared kernel owns proposal decisions, capability scope, step scheduling and immutable contributions. The agent cannot forge its actor, grant, version head or approval in tool arguments. Joining a shared plan uses `creation_update` with its proposal ID and version; an individual Markdown file does not change a website's global kind. Work-only messages do not recursively invoke the group. See [tool contract](api.md#coauthored-artifact-capabilities) and [workflow](personal/artifact-coauthoring.md).

## Personal workspace server nodes (separate from v0)

The default personal desktop also supports [Tailscale server nodes](personal/remote-nodes.md). These use authenticated `agentroom-node/1` discovery plus per-agent A2A `message/send` and `tasks/get`, not the Matrix bridge/callback/session protocol above. Task IDs equal message IDs and are persisted before a receipt; same-ID changed input conflicts. Unknown interrupted execution never auto-restarts.
